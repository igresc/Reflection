Hello and welcome on this asset pack!

First thing first: thanks a lot for the purchase!! 
I really hope you'll enjoy making games with this cute character :)

Of course, feel free to contact me via Discord (Thomas Lean#5014) or per mail (theophile.loaec@gmail.com), or even via Twitter (@ThomasLean) if you need anything. 
If you need some minor modifications (recolor, additional frames, etc), it won't be a problem for me to do it for free. If you need more assets, we can discuss about that too as a freelance commission!

For commercial use, contact me first to discuss too.


Thanks again and have fun!



Thomas Lean
